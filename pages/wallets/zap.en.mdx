Zap is a Bitcoin Lightning wallet for iOS and Android. The app is extremely user-friendly and therefore recommended to everyone. And the best part is: you can attach it to your own node via Tor. The only downside is that the Android version of the app accesses your node through LND's **RPC** API. The iOS version does support LND's **REST** API.

## Android
Download the [Zap: Bitcoin Lightning Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zapsolutions.zap) app from the Play Store. This one is still under development but that's OK.

### Preparation
Since we are running a headless server, we don't have a QR code that we can scan later so we need to paste a connection string. We create this connection string with [lndconnect](/lightning-extensions/lnd-connect) on your Pi. SSH your Pi and type:

```bash
lndconnect --host=xxx.onion --port=10009 -j
```

Where it says **xxx.onion**, of course you enter [your onion address](/lightning-extensions/lnd-connect) for LND's **RPC** API. A piece of text will appear that looks something like the following:

```bash
lndconnect://xxx.onion:10009?cert=very_many_characters&macaroon=very_many_characters
```

Copy that chunk of text from SSH and paste it into a Google Docs document, for example (because we want to have that text on our phone later).

### Zap

1. On your phone, switch to this Google Docs document and copy the entire string `lndconnect://xxx.onion:10009?cert=very_many_characters&macaroon=very_many_characters`.
2. Open Zap
3. Tap on Set up Wallet
4. Paste
3. OK

You are now connected to your own Node.

Through `Manage...` you can change the name of your wallet. By default, it gets the name of your Tor address namely.

## iOS
Download the [Zap: Bitcoin Lightning Wallet](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/zap-bitcoin-lightning-wallet/id1406311960) from the App Store. Then, when you install the app and open it for the first time, you'll be asked to come up with a PIN. Immediately after that, a screen appears that allows you to connect your node. To do this, you need to install [lndconnect](/lightning-extensions/lnd-connect) on your Pi. SSH your Pi and type:

```bash
lndconnect --host=xxx.onion --port=8080 --nocert -j
```

Where **xxx.onion** says, of course you enter [your onion address](/lightning/change-tor) for LND's **REST** API. A piece of text will appear that looks something like the following.

```bash
lndconnect://xxx.onion:8080?macaroon=many_characters
```

Copy that piece of text and open the Zap app on your iPhone. If all goes well, you'll see a screen in front of you that looks like this.

Click "Paste" and Zap will automatically fill everything in for you.

Press "Connect" and the connection is established.

### Connection over clearnet

You don't need to connect over tor. In fact, Zap works better over clearnet. You can generate a lndconnect string the same way as with tor.

```bash
lndconnect -j --host=YOUR_IP --port=10009 --adminmacaroonpath=~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon --tlscertpath=~/.lnd/tls.cert
```

You should just replace `Your_IP` for the IP of your Pi in the above command. Or if you are using a DDNS replace it with your URL.
