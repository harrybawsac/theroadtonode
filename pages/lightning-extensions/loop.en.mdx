To balance channels you have several tools, Loop is one such tool.

## Supplies

* [Golang](/raspberry-pi/common-dependencies#golang) **# (update to the latest version before you start)**.

## Installation

First, go to your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
```

Download the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightninglabs/loop
```

Enter the directory.

```bash
cd loop
```

Grab the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git checkout v0.18.0-beta
```

Go to `run/cmd`.

```bash
cd loop/cmd
```

Install the `loopd` software.

```bash
go install ./...
```

Test if it succeeded by temporarily starting Loop.

```bash
loopd
```

In the output you will read that Loop is connected to your LND and with `Ctrl + C` you can stop `loopd` again.

In addition to the Loop program, a CLI is also installed. You can check it with `loop --version`.

## Firewall

You can access Loop from the outside on two different ports.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8081 comment "Port for REST API of Loop"

sudo ufw allow 11010 comment "Port for RPC from Loop"
```

## Automation

If you want to run Loop in the background you need another service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/loop.service
```

Paste this in.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Loop
Requires=bitcoind.service
Requires=lnd.service
After=bitcoind.service
After=lnd.service

[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/go/bin/loopd
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the changes with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

Notify the system of the new service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable loop
```

Start the loop service as follows.

```bash
sudo systemctl start loop
```

If you want to see if the service was started, run this.

```bash
systemctl status loop
```

If you want a view of the status across multiple sessions, use this command.

```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u loop
```

## Updating

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/loop
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> #example v0.18.0-beta
```

Go to `cmd`.

```bash
cd cmd
```

Install the `loopd` software.

```bash
go install ./...
```

Restart the Loop and LiT services (if you have that running).

```bash
sudo systemctl restart loop

sudo systemctl restart lit
```
