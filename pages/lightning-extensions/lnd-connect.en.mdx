LND Connect (often called [lndconnect](https://github.com/LN-Zap/lndconnect)) is a tool developed by the creators of Zap wallet. The tool generates a QR code or piece of text that can be used to connect a wallet to your node. In this part of the guide we will only install lndconnect. Usage will come back in wallet sections of this guide, such as the [Zap](/wallets/zap) section.

SSH to start in your Pi. If all goes well, you already have [Go](/raspberry-pi/common-dependencies#golang) on your machine. That's good, because then we can get started right away. First go to your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
```

Get the source code from lndconnect.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LN-Zap/lndconnect
```

After downloading this, we need to go to the right directory. We also need to issue a few additional go commands because the source code has not yet been updated for recent versions of go.

```bash
cd lndconnect

rm go.mod 

go mod init github.com/LN-Zap/lndconnect

go get github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tor@v0.14.3-beta

go mod tidy
```

Finally, we can install.

```bash
make
``` 

And test if it works.

```bash
lndconnect --host IP-ADRES-Of-You-PI -j
```

If all goes well, you'll get output similar to the following.

```bash
lndconnect://192.168.1.6:10009?macaroon=[ONE_LANGE_REGLE_MET_WILL_AANDOUS_LETTERS_AND_CIJFERS]
```

With this output, you can go to Zap wallet to connect to your node.
