Faraday is an [accounting tool](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2020-09-15-faraday-accounting) for Lightning and on-chain. Useful, because you're always losing sats on things like transaction fees that often go unnoticed. Among other things, it offers the possibility to create a printout to CSV format.

## Requirements

* [Golang](/raspberry-pi/common-dependencies#golang) **\(update to the latest version before you start\)**.

## Installation

Navigate to your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
```

Download the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightninglabs/faraday
```

Go to the faraday directory.

```bash
cd faraday
```

Grab the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git checkout v0.2.7-alpha
```

Install the faraday software.

```bash
make && make install
```

There are two tools that have been installed: `faraday` and `frcli`. Faraday is the program itself and frcli is a way to communicate with Faraday. Test both to see if installation was successful.

```bash
faraday --version

frcli --version
```

You can go a step further by starting Faraday with the correct settings. In the text below, in the spots "VULGATE_USERNAME_IN" and "VULGATE_PASSWORD_IN" you need to enter the data you created during the [configuration](/bitcoin-core/configure-and-start) of Core.

```bash
faraday --lnd.macaroondir=/home/ubuntu/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet --lnd.tlscertpath=/home/ubuntu/.lnd/tls.cert --lnd.rpcserver=127.0.0.1:10009 --connect_bitcoin --bitcoin.host=127.0.0.1:8332 --bitcoin.user=ENTER_USERNAME_HERE--bitcoin.password=ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE
```

Once you see that everything is working, you can close faraday again with `Ctrl + C`.

## Firewall

You can access faraday via gRPC on port 8465.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8465 comment "Port for Faraday"
```

## Automation

Automating Faraday cannot be done very neatly. This is due to the fact that Faraday does not use a configuration file that contains the settings. Instead, you have to pass all the settings along at startup.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/faraday.service
```

Paste this in.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Faraday
Requires=bitcoind.service
Requires=lnd.service
After=bitcoind.service
After=lnd.service

[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/go/bin/faraday --lnd.macaroondir=/home/ubuntu/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet --lnd.tlscertpath=/home/ubuntu/.lnd/tls. cert --lnd.rpcserver=127.0.0.1:10009 --connect_bitcoin --bitcoin.host=127.0.0.1:8332 --bitcoin.user=ENTER_USERNAME_HERE--bitcoin.password=ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the changes with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

Notify the system of the new service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable faraday
```

Start the Faraday service as follows.

```bash
sudo systemctl start faraday
```

If you want to see if the service is started, run this.

```bash
systemctl status faraday
```

If you want a view of the status across multiple sessions, use this command.

```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u faraday
```

## Updating

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/faraday
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> #e.g. v0.2.7-alpha
```

Install the faraday software.

```bash
make && make install
```

Restart the faraday and LiT services (if you have that running).

```bash
sudo systemctl restart faraday

sudo systemctl restart lit
```
