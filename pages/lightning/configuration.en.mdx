</Callout>

The folder that LND wants to use does not exist yet. So create it first. Note that this configuration directory is different from the directory you just [installed] LND into (/lightning/installation), which was `/home/ubuntu/lnd`.

```bash
mkdir ~/.lnd
```

You create the configuration file with:

```bash
nano ~/.lnd/lnd.conf
```

Then paste the settings into it.

```toml
[Application Options]
tlsautorefresh=true
restlisten=0.0.0.0:8080
rpclisten=0.0.0.0:10009
listen=127.0.0.1:9735
maxpendingchannels=5
color=YOURSETTING_A
alias=YOURSETTING_B

[Tor]
tor.active=true
tor.v3=true
tor.streamisolation=true

[Bitcoin]
bitcoin.active=true
bitcoin.mainnet=true
bitcoin.node=bitcoind

[bitcoind]
bitcoind.dir=~/.bitcoin
bitcoind.rpcuser=FROM_BITCOIND_A
bitcoind.rpcpass=FROM_BITCOIND_B
bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
bitcoind.zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333
```
In the text above, there are four things you need to take care of yourself.

* **color**, change YOURSETTING_A to a color of your choice. It is a hexadecimal value. For example `color=#123ABC` for the color blue.
* **alias**, change YOURSETTING_B to a name of your choice. You will then get `alias=nickname`.
* **bitcoind.rpcuser**, change FROM_BITCOIND_A to [the correct user](/bitcoin-core/configure-and-start).
* **bitcoind.rpcpass**, change FROM_BITCOIND_B password to [the correct password](/bitcoin-core/configure-and-start). You have been assigned this password.

Save the file with `Ctrl + X` and `Y`.
