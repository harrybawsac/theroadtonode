The Road to Node gives you a choice between three different implementations of Electrum Server. With all three implementations you achieve the same thing, which is that you host an Electrum Server. They differ in development language, performance, and how public the servers are. [Electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs) differs from the rest because it is written in Rust. Performance-wise you should look up the differences between Electrum Personal Server, Electrum X and Electrs.

Electrs waits for Bitcoin Core to finish synchronizing. So you can't use Electrs until the synchronization is done.

## Installation

Start by installing the dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt install -y clang cmake cargo
```

Make sure you are in the home directory and get Electrs in via Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romanz/electrs
```

Go into the Electrs directory.

```bash
cd electrs
```

Finally, install Electrs with Cargo.

```bash
cargo build --locked --release
```

Test if it works. The expected output is `v0.10.4`.

```bash
./target/release/electrs --version
```

## Configuration

Electrs can be configured through a configuration file. Create it with `mkdir ~/.electrs && mkdir ~/.electrs/db && nano ~/.electrs/config.toml`. Then paste the following into the file.

```toml
cookie_file = "/home/ubuntu/.bitcoin/.cookie"
daemon_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:8332"
daemon_p2p_addr = "127.0.0.1:8333"
db_dir = "/home/ubuntu/.electrs/db"
network = "bitcoin"
electrum_rpc_addr = "0.0.0.0:50001"
log_filters = "INFO"
```

Save it with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`. You can check if it works with the same command as before: `./target/release/electrs`. You should now see an output on your screen showing that Electrs has started indexing.

## Firewall

The Electrum protocol communicates over a fixed set of ports. You can open 50001 if you want to talk to your Electrum Server using, for example, Sparrow wallet on your laptop.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 50001 comment "Port for Electrum Server"
```

If you want to monitor Electrs remotely you also need to open 4224. This is optional.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 4224 comment "Port for monitoring Electrs"
```

## Automation

Electrs can also be automated so that it runs in the background and you don't have to start it manually. First create a service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/electrs.service
```

Put the following text in there.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=electrs
Requires=bitcoind.service
After=bitcoind.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/electrs
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/electrs/target/release/electrs
User=ubuntu
Group=ubuntu
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save it with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

Enable and start the service with these two commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable electrs

sudo systemctl start electrs
```

With `systemctl status electrs` you can see if everything is running properly and get an output similar to the one below.

```bash
- electrs.service - electrs
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/electrs.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2022-01-14 20:36:59 UTC; 35s ago
   Main PID: 67163 (electrs)
      Tasks: 20 (limit: 4203)
     CGroup: /system.slice/electrs.service
             67163 /home/ubuntu/electrs/target/release/electrs
```

## Updating

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/electrs
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```bash
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> # for example 0.10.4
```

Install the software.

```bash
cargo build --locked --release
```

Restart the Electrs service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart electrs
```

Electrs is now updated! You may find that during the restart - something that can take several minutes - your node can't do anything else.
