Mempool.space allows you to keep track of bitcoin's mempool yourself. This is useful for determining how much fee to pay or to see if your transaction has already gone through. By hosting it yourself you are not handing over any data to third parties.

## Preparation

1. [Electrs](/bitcoin-core-extensions/electrs)
2. [NodeJS](/raspberry-pi/general-dependencies-install#nodejs)

## Installation

Get the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mempool/mempool
```

Enter the directory with `cd mempool`. Then put the latest release in a temporary variable called `latestrelease` in your terminal.

```bash
latestrelease=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/mempool/mempool/releases/latest|grep tag_name|head -1|cut -d ''' -f4)
```

Then grab the latest version with `git checkout $latestrelease`.

## Maria DB

Mempool.space needs a database to store some data in. That's why it uses Maria DB.

```bash
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y
```

Log in to Maria DB.

```bash
sudo mariadb -u root
```

Once in Maria DB, you can execute SQL code. Mempool.space needs a database so create it. Execute all of the command, including the `;`.

```sql
create database mempool;
```

Then create a user who will have access to that particular database.

```sql
grant all privileges on mempool.* to 'mempool'@'%' identified by 'mempool';
```

Finally, you can close the database connection with `quit;`.

## Backend

The tool consists of two parts which run separately: a backend and a frontend. The frontend is shown in your browser and the backend requested the data for the frontend. Enter the backend directory with `cd backend`. Then install the backend dependencies with `npm install --prod` after which you make a build `npm run build`.

The backend needs a configuration and for that we have a JSON file. Copy the sample configuration to a usable one.

```bash
cp mempool-config.sample.json mempool-config.json
```


Open the file `nano mempool-config.json`. If all goes well, the file looks like the one below. It is quite large and take great care to change the right things:

* `FROM_BITCOIND_A` and `FROM_BITCOIND_C`: [The user](/bitcoin-core/configure-and-start) that you created.
* `FROM_BITCOIND_B` and `FROM_BITCOIND_D`: [The password](/bitcoin-core/configure-and-start) that you were given.

  }
}
```

### Frontend

Now that the backend is taken care of we can focus on the frontend. This starts with navigating to the right directory.

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Again you need to install the dependencies with `npm install --prod`. Then you can copy the sample configuration, but you don't need to modify it.

```bash
cp mempool-frontend-config.sample.json mempool-frontend-config.json
```

<Callout emoji="&#x2139;">
        It may happen that the build below fails. If so, please try again later. Unfortunately there is no better solution for this.
</Callout>

You can build the frontend with `npm run build` (may take quite some time) and finally move the output of the build to another directory. Nginx will redirect traffic to that directory.

```bash
sudo rsync -av --delete dist/ /var/www/
```

## Server

The website is only available through Nginx.

```bash
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

After installing Nginx, go back to the root of the project with `cd ~/mempool`. From there, install the Nginx configuration from mempool.

```bash
sudo cp nginx.conf nginx-mempool.conf /etc/nginx/
```

Then modify two lines of the configuration with `sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. A screen will open where you will see in the top line `user nobody;`. Change it to `user ubuntu;`. Scroll down to the bottom where you will see `listen 127.0.0.1:80;`. That should become `listen 0.0.0.0:80;`. Save it with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`. You can check the configuration with `sudo nginx -t` whose output should look like:

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

To finish the Nginx setup, restart Nginx with `sudo systemctl restart nginx`.

## Firewall

Reaching mempool.space is done through normal internet addresses (clearnet). On port 80. Nginx further handles where the traffic goes.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80 comment "Port for normal internet traffic"
```

## Automation

The frontend of mempool.space is now in a folder you don't need worry about. However, it is important that the backend runs in the background. We create a service for this.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mempool.service
```

Put the following text in there.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Mempool
Requires=bitcoind.service
Requires=electrs.service
After=bitcoind.service
After=electrs.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/mempool/backend
ExecStart=npm run start
User=ubuntu
Group=ubuntu
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save it with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

Enable and start the service with these two commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mempool

sudo systemctl start mempool
```

With `sudo systemctl status mempool` you can see if everything is running properly and get an output similar to the one below.

```bash
● mempool.service - Mempool
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/mempool.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

```

## Updating

Go to the application directory.

```bash
cd ~/mempool
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Then put the latest release in a temporary variable called `latestrelease` in your terminal.

```bash
latestrelease=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/mempool/mempool/releases/latest|grep tag_name|head -1|cut -d ''' -f4)
```

Get the latest version with `git checkout $latestrelease`.

### Update backend

Enter the backend directory with `cd backend`. Then install the backend dependencies with `npm install --prod` after which you make a build `npm run build`.

Restart the mempool service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mempool
```

### Update frontend

First, go to the directory containing the frontend code.

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Again, you need to install the dependencies with `npm install --prod`.

<Callout emoji="&#x2139;">
        It may happen that the build below fails. Please try again later. Unfortunately there is no better solution for this.
</Callout>

You can build the frontend with `npm run build` (can take quite a long time). The Nginx directory with the production version should be updated automatically.
