# BTC RPC Explorer

	Time: 20 minutes
</Callout>

Having your own block explorer helps you in ensuring your privacy, as you no longer have to consult a public block explorer. This way you can check your transactions undisturbed to see if they are still in the mempool or have already been validated.

The Block Explorer we are going to use is [BTC RPC Explorer](https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer) by Dan Janosik.

<Callout emoji="&#x2139;">
	Note that this section is dependent on the [NodeJS installation](/raspberry-pi/common-dependencies#nodejs). You cannot proceed if you do not have NodeJS installed on the Raspberry Pi.
</Callout>

## Preparation

There are a number of requirements that you must meet in order to run this block explorer:

1. You must have a full node running of which the blockchain is complete.
2. Your node must also have an index of all transactions.
3. You must have a recent version of NodeJS running.

### Full node

You're on the road to node. If you are doing it in the right order you have [Bitcoin Core](/bitcoin-core/installation) installed by now. If not do that first.

### Transaction Index

Login to your Pi and open the bitcoin configuration file.

```bash
nano /home/ubuntu/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
```

Check to see if the line `txindex=1` appears in it. If not, add it and save your changes with `Ctrl + X` followed by `Y`.

Next, restart `bitcoind`.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bitcoind
```

## Firewall

Again, the firewall needs to be updated. The port over which BTC RPC Explorer shows up is 3002.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3002 comment "Port for BTC-RPC-Explorer"
```

## Installation

Make sure you are in the home directory.

```bash
cd ~
```

Get the source code in.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/janoside/btc-rpc-explorer
```

Enter the BTC RPC Explorer directory.

```bash
cd btc-rpc-explorer
```

Grab the latest release.

```bash
git checkout v3.3.0
```

Install BTC RPC Explorer and then create the configuration file `.env`.

```bash
npm install

nano .env
```

Paste the following lines in there.

```bash
BTCEXP_HOST=IP ADDRESS OF PI
BTCEXP_PORT=3002

BTCEXP_BITCOIND_HOST=127.0.0.1
BTCEXP_BITCOIND_PORT=8332
BTCEXP_BITCOIND_COOKIE=/home/ubuntu/.bitcoin/.cookie
BTCEXP_BITCOIND_RPC_TIMEOUT=5000

BTCEXP_PRIVACY_MODE=true
```

Modify the text `IP ADDRESS OF PI` to what is applicable to you. So replace it with something similar to `192.168.1.6`. Save the file with `Ctrl + X` followed by `Y`.

<Callout emoji="&#x2139;">
	Open the file `.env-sample` to see what other options there are.
</Callout>

## Automation

Now make sure that the BTC-RPC-Explorer starts automatically and runs as a service when your Pi reboots.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/btc-rpc-explorer.service
```

The contents of the file should look like this. In particular, the path to the `WorkingDirectory` is important.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=BTC-RPC-Explorer
Requires=bitcoind.service
After=bitcoind.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/btc-rpc-explorer
ExecStart=npm run start
User=ubuntu
Group=ubuntu
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the file with `Ctrl + X` followed by `Y`.

With the following two commands, activate and start the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable btc-rpc-explorer

sudo systemctl start btc-rpc-explorer
```

Now in Firefox on your PC, open a tab to `http://IP-ADRES FROM PI:3002` to see if it works. For example `http://192.168.1.6:3002`.

## Updating

If there is a new version available for BTC RPC Explorer you can easily update it by getting the new source with Git and installing it. First stop the service and then start it again as shown below.

```
sudo systemctl stop btc-rpc-explorer
```

Enter the BTC RPC Explorer directory.

```
cd ~/btc-rpc-explorer
```

Update the repository with the latest changes via Git.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

Show the latest version/tag/release.

```
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1``
```

Retrieve the changes from the latest release.

```bash
git checkout -f <OUTPUT FROM PREVIOUS STEP> #example: v3.3.0
```

Install via NPM.

```bash
npm install
```

Restart the service after install is finished.

```
sudo systemctl start btc-rpc-explorer
```

## Tor

You can also make the service available through Tor. First, we modify the Tor configuration to create a new hidden service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
```

In the file that opens, add the following three lines at the bottom.

```bash
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/btc-rpc-explorer
HiddenServiceVersion 3
HiddenServicePort 3002 127.0.0.1:3002
```

After Tor is configured we need to create the appropriate directories and assign permissions.

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/tor/btc-rpc-explorer
sudo chown -R debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/btc-rpc-explorer
sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/tor/btc-rpc-explorer
```

Restart Tor with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tor
```

Find the onion address with the following command:

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/btc-rpc-explorer/hostname
```

Enter this (with port number) into your Tor browser. The BTC RPC Explorer homepage should appear.

## Linking with Electrum Server

If you followed the Electrum Server (Electrs, Electrum X, or Electrum Personal Server) guide, you can connect BTC RPC Explorer directly to it for enhanced privacy. Modify the configuration file of BTC RPC Explorer.

```bash
nano ~/btc-rpc-explorer/.env
```

At the bottom, add the following two lines:

```toml
BTCEXP_ADDRESS_API=electrum
BTCEXP_ELECTRUM_SERVERS=tcp://127.0.0.1:50001
```

If you want to make sure that the explorer only uses your own backend, you can also modify the service and pass along that it should only run when the Electrum Server is running. The example below shows Electrs as an example, but modify it as appropriate for you.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/btc-rpc-explorer.service
```

The custom service will then look like this:

```toml
[Unit]
Description=BTC-RPC-Explorer
Requires=electrs.service
After=electrs.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/btc-rpc-explorer
ExecStart=npm run start
User=ubuntu
Group=ubuntu
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This way Electrs waits for Bitcoin Core and BTC RPC Explorer waits for Electrs.

After modifying services, systemctl needs to be reloaded briefly with `systemctl daemon-reload`. Your password is needed for this.

Finally, restart the explorer service to make the new configuration effective and use your own backend.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart btc-rpc-explorer
```
