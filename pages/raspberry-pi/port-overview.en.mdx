# Port overview

<Callout emoji="&#x2139;">
	This serves as a reference guide should you lose track a bit. Understandable, since your node doesn't have a fancy, easy-to-use front end.

The following is a list of all the ports that are approachable on your Raspberry Pi. You can access certain tools by entering in your browser the IP address of your Pi followed by the port number. For example `192.168.1.6:3002` to see BTC RPC Explorer. If you want to access the tools over Tor, you will need to modify the `torrc` file for each tool. You can then make certain ports accessible to the outside world and forward them to a local port on your Pi. How this works is usually explained within The Road to Node in the tool of choice.

We will assume the default values for all tools, with the exception of Thunderhub. This is due to the fact that Ride the Lightning runs on the same port.ort draait.

### Bitcoin Core

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **8332** | The JSON-RPC port. With the right username/password combination, you can talk to this. By default, Bitcoin Core only accepts connections from the Pi itself. Therefore, a tool running on the Pi will be allowed to talk to the RPC port, but a random attacker from the outside will not. |
| **8333** | This port is responsible for communication with other clients on the Bitcoin network. |
| **28332** | The Bitcoin Daemon can use the ZeroMQ protocol to send block information to clients. This way, the clients do not have to make a request via the JSON-RPC every time, but can do so on a subscription basis. |
| **28333** | The same as port 28332 but for transactions instead of blocks. |

### Tor

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **9050** | If you want a particular application to communicate over the Tor network, you must tell the application to use port 9050.  |

### BTC RPC Explorer

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3002** | The BTC RPC Explorer can be accessed via this port. |

### Electrum \(for Electrs, Electrum X and Electrum Personal Server\)

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **4224** | Monitoring of Electrs. |
| **8000** | Standard RPC port of the Electrum protocol. |
| **50001** | Standard port for TCP connections. |
| **50002** | Standard port for SSL connections. |
| **50004** | Standard port for secure websocket connections. |


### Specter

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **25441** | Navigating to this port will show the Specter overview|

### Lightning Network Daemon (LND)

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **8080** | The port with which the REST API of LND can be accessed. Secured with a so-called macaroon. |
| **9735** | The port which connects with other nodes. A bit like 8333 for Bitcoin Core. |
| **10009** | The port with which the RPC API of LND makes itself approachable. Secured with a so-called macaroon. |

### Loop

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **8081** | REST port for loopd. |
| **11010** | RPC port for loopd. |

### Faraday

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **8465** | RPC port for faraday. |

### Pool

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **8281** | REST port for poold. |
| **12010** | RPC port for poold. |

### Lightning Terminal

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **8443** | LiT runs on this port. |

### Ride the Lightning

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3000** | The Ride the Lightning interface can be used if you go to this port. |

### Thunderhub

| Port | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **4000** | By default, this tool is set to port 3000. But since Ride The Lightning already uses that, in this guide we choose port 4000. |
